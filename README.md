# Audits
My complete audit portfolio in public and private security competitions.

# Audit methodology

1. Understand the protocol & its intentions.
2. Find all logical bugs, criticals & H/M web3 vulnerabilities.
3. Suggest Low/QA & Gas/Code Optimisations.
4. Clear communication in the entire process & post audit support.
